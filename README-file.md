### What I learned

It has been few months i tried coding and when i took this challenge from frontend mentor, it was a little difficult for me to do but thankfully i tried some online solutions like MDN, W3 schools in asking some few questions to help solve this challenge. It was difficult for me creating a border box where i can include my text and image.
